We compare previous estimates of social security fraud in Norway made using a comparable methodology to that which we have applied to white-collar crime. Although the estimated 9.8 billion NOK for social security fraud is enormous in a nation like Norway, we suggest that the amount for white-collar crime is even bigger. We also apply social conflict theory to discuss the issue of priorities in law enforcement between social security fraud versus white-collar crime. According to social conflict theory, the justice system is biased and designed to protect the wealthy and powerful.  They  will  never  accept  the  view  that  minor  fraud  prosecution represents a kind of over-criminalization targeted at the losers in society."

When experts are asked about the magnitude of the three different kinds of economic crime illustrated in the figure, psy-chological biases may, for example, cause left-wing respondents to claim a large fraction of undetected white-collar crime, while right-wing respon-dents may claim a large fraction of undetected social security fraud, simply because  they  disagree  about  law  enforcement  priorities.  Kynn  (2008) argues that humans make probability judgments through a series of heu-ristics which lead to systematic and predictable biases. She suggests that researchers  should  be  equally  concerned  with  what  they  ask  experts  to assess and how they ask it. Probability elicitation is influenced by a number of factors such as the tendency to judge the frequency of an event by the ease  of  remembering  specific  examples.  Furthermore,  anchoring  and adjustment is the tendency to anchor a probability estimate at an initial value  and  then  to  adjust  it  outwards.  Insufficient  adjustment  results  in biases of overestimation or underestimation when judging."

The wealthy and powerful can take substantial assets out of their own companies at their own discre-tion whenever they like, although employed workers in the companies are the ones who create the value. The super-rich can exploit the wealth that they have created as owners of corporations as long as they do not hurt other shareholders and employees have no right to object. It is no crime to take out value from one[~]s own enterprise and build private mansions with the money. Even when owners have simply inherited wealth created by  earlier  generations,  they  can  use  it  freely  for  private  consumption. Similarly, top executives who are on each other[~]s corporate boards grant each other salaries that are 10[~]20 times higher than regular employee sala-ries. As Haines (2014: 21) puts it, [~]financial practices that threaten corpo-rate interests, such as embezzlement, are clearly identified as criminal even as obscenely high salaries remain relatively untouched by regulatory con-trols[~]. Furthermore, sharp practices such as insider trading that threaten confidence in equities markets have enjoyed vigorous prosecution, since the powerful see them as opaque transactions that give an unfair advantage to those who are not members of the market institutions."

Marx  divided  society  into  two  unequal  classes  and  demonstrated  the inequality in the historical transition from patrician and slave to capitalist and wage worker: this is the rulers versus the ruled. Marx also underlined that all societies have a certain hierarchy wherein a higher class has more privileges  than  a  lower  one.
